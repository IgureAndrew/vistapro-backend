# ðŸŽ¯ Email Verification Fix Summary

## **Problem Identified**

The email verification was failing with a 404 error because of a **mismatch between frontend and backend API calls**.

### **Frontend (WRONG):**
```javascript
// POST request with token in body
axios.post(`${API_BASE}/api/auth/verify-email`, { token })
```

### **Backend (CORRECT):**
```javascript
// GET request with token in URL
router.get('/verify-email/:token', verifyEmail);
```

---

## **Root Cause**

The frontend was sending a **POST** request with the token in the request body, but the backend expected a **GET** request with the token as a URL parameter.

---

## **Solution Applied**

Changed the frontend to match the backend API:

```javascript
// Changed from POST to GET
// Changed from body to URL parameter
axios.get(`${API_BASE}/api/auth/verify-email/${token}`)
```

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/components/EmailVerification.jsx`

## **Commit**

```
c3db921 - Fix: Change email verification from POST to GET with token in URL
```

## **What Happens Next**

1. âœ… **Vercel** will automatically detect the new commit
2. âœ… **Vercel** will trigger a new deployment
3. âœ… **Frontend** will be updated with the fix
4. âœ… **Email verification** will work correctly

---

## **Expected Behavior After Deployment**

1. User receives verification email
2. User clicks verification link: `https://www.vistapro.ng/email-verification?token=XXXXX`
3. Frontend calls: `GET https://vistapro-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/verify-email/XXXXX`
4. Backend verifies the token
5. User sees success message
6. User can log in

---

## **Testing After Deployment**

1. Go to https://www.vistapro.ng
2. Register a new user with your real email
3. Check your email for verification link
4. Click the verification link
5. You should see: "Email verified successfully!"
6. You can now log in

---

## **Verification**

You can test the backend endpoint directly:

```bash
curl https://vistapro-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/verify-email/YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

If the token is valid, you should get:
```json
{
  "message": "Email verified successfully. You can now log in to your account."
}
```

---

**Status**: âœ… Fix deployed to GitHub
**Next Step**: Wait for Vercel deployment to complete, then test email verification
