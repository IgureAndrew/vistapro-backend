# MasterAdmin Dashboard - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The MasterAdmin dashboard now includes a **comprehensive KYC tracking system** that allows you to:
- View ALL submissions at every stage of the verification process
- Track the complete journey of each submission with detailed timestamps
- Filter and sort submissions by status, date, and other criteria

---

## 📊 Understanding the Dashboard

### **Current Status (as of now)**

Your dashboard shows:
- **Total Submissions: 1** (this is the approved submission from Bayo Lawal)
- **Pending Approval: 0** (no submissions are currently waiting for MasterAdmin approval)
- **Marketer Verifications: 0** (no submissions are currently in the marketer verification stage)

### **Why You Don't See the 3 Submissions Yet**

The 3 submissions from today are currently at **`pending_admin_review`** status:
1. OLUWATOBI ODUNADE (DSR00344)
2. Olaopa Feranmi (DSR00346)
3. KABIR ADEMOLA OLORODE (DSR00351)

These submissions need to go through the complete workflow:
```
Marketer Forms → Admin Review → SuperAdmin Review → MasterAdmin Approval
```
