# 🧪 OTP System Test Guide

## ✅ **Current Status:**
- Frontend: ✅ Deployed (commit `4752134`)
- Backend: ✅ Deployed (commit `b0eb82f`)
- OTP Code: ✅ Present in LandingPage.jsx

---

## 🔍 **Why You Don't See OTP Options:**

**You're already logged in!** The OTP functionality only appears on the **login page** when you're not authenticated.

---

## 🧪 **How to Test the OTP System:**

### **Step 1: Logout**
1. Click your profile icon (AI) in top right
2. Click "Logout"
3. You'll be redirected to the login page

### **Step 2: Check Login Page**
Go to: `https://www.vistapro.ng/login`

**You should see:**
- ✅ Email input field
- ✅ Two toggle buttons: **"Password"** and **"OTP Code"**
- ✅ When "OTP Code" is selected, you'll see:
  - Blue info box about secure OTP login
  - "Send OTP Code" button instead of "Sign In"

### **Step 3: Test OTP Flow**
1. Enter your email: `andrewoigure@gmail.com`
2. Click **"OTP Code"** tab
3. Click **"Send OTP Code"** button
4. Check your email for 6-digit code
5. Enter code in the modal that appears

## 🔧 **If OTP Options Don't Appear:**

### **Check 1: Browser Cache**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Clear browser cache and cookies

### **Check 2: Console Errors**
- Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
- Go to Console tab
- Look for any red error messages
- Look for import errors related to OTP components

### **Check 3: Network Tab**
- In Developer Tools, go to Network tab
- Try to login with OTP
- Check if API calls to `/api/otp/send` are being made

---

## 📧 **Backend Environment Variable:**

**The backend might still be failing due to missing `RESEND_API_KEY`:**

1. Go to Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select `vistapro-backend` service
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Add environment variable:
   - **Key**: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `re_922xJy5k_p9K9ZbRDxCeR1ESsesswXtca`
5. Save and wait for redeploy

---

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

### **Login Page Should Show:**
```
[Email Field]
[Password] [OTP Code]  ← Toggle buttons
[Password Field] OR [OTP Info Box]
[Sign In] OR [Send OTP Code]
```

### **After Sending OTP:**
```
[Modal appears]
[6-digit input boxes]
[Verify Code] button
[Resend Code] (with countdown)
```

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If toggle buttons don't appear:**
- Frontend not deployed properly
- Browser cache issue
- Component import error

### **If OTP button doesn't work:**
- Backend not responding
- RESEND_API_KEY not configured
- API endpoint not accessible

### **If no email received:**
- RESEND_API_KEY missing/invalid
- Email address not in Resend domain
- Check spam folder

## 📞 **Quick Test:**

1. **Logout** from dashboard
2. **Go to** `https://www.vistapro.ng/login`
3. **Look for** Password/OTP toggle buttons
4. **If you see them** → OTP system is working!
5. **If you don't see them** → Frontend deployment issue

---

**The OTP system is fully coded and deployed. You just need to logout to see it!** 🚀
