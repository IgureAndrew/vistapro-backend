## 🎯 Current Situation Explained

### **Why You Don't See Them in "Pending Approval" Tab:**
The 3 submissions are at **"Pending Admin Review"** status. They need to go through:
1. Admin Review (not started)
2. SuperAdmin Review (not started)
3. **Then** they'll appear in your "Pending Approval" tab

### **Why "Show All Submissions" is Important:**
Without this toggle, you only see submissions that are ready for YOUR approval. With it enabled, you can see:
- ✅ All submissions at every stage
- ✅ Track their progress through the workflow
- ✅ Identify bottlenecks
- ✅ Monitor the entire verification pipeline

- This shows the count of submissions that have reached the final stage
- Currently shows 1 (Bayo Lawal's approved submission)
