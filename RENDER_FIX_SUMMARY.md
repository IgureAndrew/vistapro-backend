# üéØ Render Deployment Fix Summary

## **Problem Identified**

The Render deployment was failing with the error:
```
TypeError: requireRole is not a function
```

This was caused by **TWO conflicting `render.yaml` files** in the repository:

1. ‚úÖ `render.yaml` (correct) - had `startCommand: node start.js`
2. ‚ùå `.render.yaml` (WRONG) - had `startCommand: node server.js`

The `.render.yaml` file was overriding the correct `render.yaml` configuration, causing Render to use the wrong start command.

## **Root Cause**

- The `.render.yaml` file specified `startCommand: node server.js` but there is no `server.js` file in the backend folder
- The correct entry point is `start.js` as defined in `backend/package.json`
- The conflicting `.render.yaml` file was preventing Render from using the correct configuration

## **Solution Applied**

1. ‚úÖ **Deleted** the conflicting `.render.yaml` file
2. ‚úÖ **Kept** the correct `render.yaml` file with proper configuration:
   - `rootDir: backend`
   - `buildCommand: npm install`
   - `startCommand: node start.js`
3. ‚úÖ **Committed and pushed** the fix to the repository

## **Current Configuration**

### `render.yaml` (Correct File)
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: vistapro-backend
    env: node
    plan: free
    rootDir: backend
    buildCommand: npm install
    startCommand: node start.js
    envVars:
      - key: NODE_ENV
        value: production
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
            name: vistapro-db
            property: connectionString
    healthCheckPath: /api/health
```

## **What Happens Next**

1. Render will automatically detect the new commit
2. Render will trigger a new deployment
3. The deployment should now succeed because:
   - The `rootDir` is correctly set to `backend`
   - The `startCommand` is correctly set to `node start.js`
   - All files are in the correct location

## **Verification Steps**

After the deployment completes, verify:
1. ‚úÖ Backend starts successfully
2. ‚úÖ Database connection works
3. ‚úÖ API endpoints are accessible
4. ‚úÖ User management routes work (lock, unlock, delete, restore)

## **Files Changed**

- **Deleted**: `.render.yaml` (conflicting file)
- **Kept**: `render.yaml` (correct configuration)
