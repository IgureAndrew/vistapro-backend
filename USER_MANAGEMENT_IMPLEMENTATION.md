## üîß Backend Implementation

### Controller: `backend/src/controllers/userManagementController.js`

**API Endpoints:**

1. **Lock User Account**
   - `PUT /api/user-management/:id/lock`
   - Requires: `reason` in request body
   - MasterAdmin only

2. **Unlock User Account**
   - `PUT /api/user-management/:id/unlock`
   - MasterAdmin only

3. **Soft Delete User**
   - `DELETE /api/user-management/:id/soft`
   - Preserves all user data
   - MasterAdmin only

4. **Hard Delete User**
   - `DELETE /api/user-management/:id/hard`
   - Permanently removes all user data
   - MasterAdmin only

5. **Restore User**
   - `PUT /api/user-management/:id/restore`
   - Restores soft-deleted account
   - MasterAdmin only

6. **Get Deleted Users**
   - `GET /api/user-management/deleted`
   - Returns all soft-deleted users with their data
   - MasterAdmin only

7. **Get User Activity**
   - `GET /api/user-management/:id/activity`
   - Returns complete activity history for soft-deleted users
   - MasterAdmin only

8. **Check User Status**
   - `GET /api/user-management/:id/status`
   - Returns lock/deletion status
   - MasterAdmin only

### Routes: `backend/src/routes/userManagementRoutes.js`
- All routes protected with `authenticateToken` middleware
- All routes restricted to `MasterAdmin` role only

### Login Protection: `backend/src/controllers/authController.js`
- Updated `loginUser` function to check:
  - `is_locked` - Shows lock reason if account is locked
  - `is_deleted` - Blocks login for deleted accounts
  - `deletion_type` - Distinguishes between hard and soft delete

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Connect to production database
psql -h <host> -U <user> -d <database>

# Run migration
\i backend/migrations/0027_add_user_management_fields.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Backend
```bash
# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add user management system for MasterAdmin"
git push backend master

# Render will automatically deploy
```

### 3. Deploy Frontend
```bash
# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add user management UI for MasterAdmin"
git push frontend master

# Vercel will automatically deploy
```

### 4. Test the System
1. Login as MasterAdmin

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Soft Delete vs Hard Delete

**Soft Delete (Recommended):**
- ‚úÖ Preserves all user data
- ‚úÖ Can be restored
- ‚úÖ Maintains audit trail
- ‚úÖ Safe for most cases

**Hard Delete (Use Carefully):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Permanently removes all data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot be undone
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Removes from all tables
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only use when absolutely necessary

### Best Practices

1. **Always use Soft Delete first** - You can always hard delete later if needed
2. **Provide clear lock reasons** - Helps users understand why they're locked
3. **Review activity before deleting** - Check user's history before permanent deletion
4. **Use audit logs** - Track all actions for accountability
5. **Test in development first** - Always test new features before production

## üîç Monitoring

### Check Audit Logs
```sql
SELECT 
  u.first_name || ' ' || u.last_name as user_name,
  a.action,
  admin.first_name || ' ' || admin.last_name as performed_by,
  a.reason,
  a.created_at
FROM user_management_audit a
JOIN users u ON a.user_id = u.id
JOIN users admin ON a.performed_by = admin.id
ORDER BY a.created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Check Locked Users
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  first_name || ' ' || last_name as name,
  email,
  role,
  lock_reason,
  locked_at
FROM users
WHERE is_locked = true;
```

### Check Soft-Deleted Users
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  first_name || ' ' || last_name as name,
  email,
  role,
  deleted_at,
  deletion_type
FROM users
WHERE is_deleted = true AND deletion_type = 'soft';
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the audit logs for errors
