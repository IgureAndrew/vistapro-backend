# What You Should See Now - Quick Guide

## 🎯 **Current Situation**

Your dashboard is showing:
- ✅ **Total Submissions: 1**
- ✅ **Pending Approval: 0**
- ✅ **Marketer Verifications: 0**
- ✅ **Approved: 1**
- ✅ **Rejected: 0**

## 📊 **Why You See "No Submissions Found"**

### **Reason 1: The Toggle Button**
The **"Show Only Pending MasterAdmin"** button is currently active. This means:
- ✅ It's filtering to show ONLY submissions at `pending_masteradmin_approval` status
- ❌ It's hiding submissions at other stages (like `pending_admin_review`)

### **Reason 2: Current Submission Status**
Your submissions are at different stages:

| Submission | Current Status | Where It Should Appear |
|------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Bayo Lawal | `approved` | History tab ✅ |
| OLUWATOBI ODUNADE | `pending_admin_review` | Pending tab (need to click "Show All Submissions") |
| Olaopa Feranmi | `pending_admin_review` | Pending tab (need to click "Show All Submissions") |
| KABIR ADEMOLA OLORODE | `pending_admin_review` | Pending tab (need to click "Show All Submissions") |
| Isiaka Afeez Oluwaferanmi | `pending_marketer_forms` | Pending tab (need to click "Show All Submissions") |
