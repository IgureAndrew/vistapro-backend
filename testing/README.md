# Testing Directory

## Purpose
This directory is for temporary testing files and scripts. All files here should be deleted after testing is complete.

## Structure
- `scripts/` - Temporary test scripts
- `data/` - Test data files
- `logs/` - Test logs
- `temp/` - Temporary files

## Rules
1. **Clean up after testing** - Delete all files when done
2. **No production code** - Only test files here
3. **Document what you're testing** - Use clear file names
4. **Remove this folder** - When all testing is complete

## Current Tests
